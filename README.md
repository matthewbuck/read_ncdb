# read_ncdb
This is a basic reader for .dat files from the National Cancer Database. <br />
Please note that most data are read as doubles, except for those specified as characters. <br />
Significant processing after reading is needed. <br />
<br /><p>
You will need to place your own SAS settings file from the NCDB in the same directory as this script. </p>
<p>
The eventual goal is to create a package for processing of these files in R. </p>
