# read_ncdb
This is a *very* basic reader for .dat files from the National Cancer Database. <br />
Please note that data in columns is read in as doubles, except for the ones specified as characters. <br />
Significant processing after reading is recommended. <br />
<br /><p>
You will need to place your own SAS settings file from the NCDB in the same directory as this script. </p>
<p>
The eventual goal is to turn this reader into a package with tools for processing of these files in R. </p>
